# 🛒 Kroger MCP Server 🛍️ -- FastMCP for Kroger Shopping

![Logo](media/harper_logo.jpeg)

A [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) server that provides AI assistants like Claude with access to Kroger's grocery shopping functionality through the Model Context Protocol ([MCP](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp)). This server enables AI assistants to find stores, search products, manage shopping carts, and access Kroger's comprehensive grocery data via the [kroger-api](https://github.com/CupOfOwls/kroger-api) python library.

## ⚡ Configure in your MCP client

Everything below assumes you have Kroger API credentials — free, self-serve, from the
[Kroger Developer Portal](https://developer.kroger.com/manage/apps/register). See
[Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for the walkthrough.

### JSON MCP config

Most MCP hosts (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and friends) take an `mcpServers` block.
Point it at this repo's virtualenv:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kroger": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/kroger-mcp/.venv/bin/kroger-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "KROGER_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "KROGER_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret",
        "KROGER_REDIRECT_URI": "http://localhost:8000/callback",
        "KROGER_USER_ZIP_CODE": "10001"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Create that virtualenv first:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .
```

If you have `uv` installed you can skip the venv and use `"command": "uvx", "args": ["kroger-mcp"]`
instead.

### Hermes

Hermes uses the same shape, in YAML, under `mcp_servers:` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  kroger:
    command: /absolute/path/to/kroger-mcp/.venv/bin/kroger-mcp
    args: []
    enabled: true
    env:
      KROGER_CLIENT_ID: "your_client_id"
      KROGER_CLIENT_SECRET: "your_client_secret"
      KROGER_REDIRECT_URI: "http://localhost:8000/callback"
      KROGER_USER_ZIP_CODE: "10001"
```

Or let the CLI write it for you:

```bash
hermes mcp add kroger --command /absolute/path/to/kroger-mcp/.venv/bin/kroger-mcp --env KROGER_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id KROGER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret KROGER_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/callback KROGER_USER_ZIP_CODE=10001
```

Then confirm it connects and see the tool list:

```bash
hermes mcp test kroger
```

Credentials can live in `.env` next to the repo instead of the `env` block, if you prefer
to keep secrets out of your client config.

### ⚠️ What this server can and cannot do to your cart

It can **add** items, search products, and set your preferred store. It **cannot remove
items or change quantities** — Kroger's public Cart API exposes exactly one endpoint,
`PUT /v1/cart/add`, with no read, update, or delete. Removals happen in the Kroger app.
See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the verified endpoint tables.

> **This is a fork** of [CupOfOwls/kroger-mcp](https://github.com/CupOfOwls/kroger-mcp) (MIT).
> Changes: removed the `remove_from_cart` / `clear_current_cart` tools, which mutated only a
> local file while appearing to edit the real cart; documented the actual Kroger API surface in
> [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); added MCP client setup docs above.

## Changelog
A changelog with recent changes is [here](CHANGELOG.md).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
You will need Kroger API credentials (free from [Kroger Developer Portal](https://developer.kroger.com/)).
Visit the [Kroger Developer Portal](https://developer.kroger.com/manage/apps/register) to:
1. Create a developer account
2. Register your application
3. Get your `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and set your `REDIRECT_URI`

The first time you run a tool requiring user authentication, you'll be prompted to authorize your app through your web browser. You're granting permission to **your own registered app**, not to any third party.

### Installation
##### ⚠️ macOS users must use installation Option 2 ⚠️

#### Option 1: Using uvx with Claude Desktop (Recommended)
Once published to PyPI, you can use uvx to run the package directly without cloning the repository:

Edit Claude Desktop's configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`


**Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kroger": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "kroger-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "KROGER_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "KROGER_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret", 
        "KROGER_REDIRECT_URI": "http://localhost:8000/callback",
        "KROGER_USER_ZIP_CODE": "10001"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Benefits of this method:
- Automatically installs the package from PyPI if needed
- Creates an isolated environment for running the server
- Makes it easy to stay updated with the latest version
- Doesn't require maintaining a local repository clone

#### Option 2: Using uv with a Local Clone
First, clone locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CupOfOwls/kroger-mcp
```

Then, edit Claude Desktop's configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kroger": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/cloned/kroger-mcp",
        "run",
        "kroger-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "KROGER_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "KROGER_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret", 
        "KROGER_REDIRECT_URI": "http://localhost:8000/callback",
        "KROGER_USER_ZIP_CODE": "10001"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Installing From PyPI

```bash
# Install with uv (recommended)
uv pip install kroger-mcp

# Or install with pip
pip install kroger-mcp
```

#### Option 4: Installing From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CupOfOwls/kroger-mcp
cd kroger-mcp

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or install with pip
pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root or pass in env values via the JSON config:

```bash
# Required: Your Kroger API credentials
KROGER_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
KROGER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
KROGER_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/callback

# Optional: Default zip code for location searches
KROGER_USER_ZIP_CODE=90274
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# With uv (recommended)
uv run kroger-mcp

# With uvx (directly from PyPI without installation)
uvx kroger-mcp

# Or with Python directly
python server.py

# With FastMCP CLI for development
fastmcp dev server.py --with-editable .
```

### 🧰 Local-Only Cart Tracking

Since the Kroger API doesn't provide cart viewing functionality, this server maintains local tracking:

#### Local Cart Storage
- **File**: `kroger_cart.json`
- **Contents**: Current cart items with timestamps
- **Automatic**: Created and updated automatically

#### Order History
- **File**: `kroger_order_history.json`
- **Contents**: Historical orders with placement timestamps
- **Usage**: Move completed carts to history with `mark_order_placed`

#### Where these files live

State files (cart, order history, preferences) and OAuth tokens are stored in the first matching location:
1. `$KROGER_TOKEN_DIR`, if you set that environment variable
2. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kroger-mcp/` (defaults to `~/.local/share/kroger-mcp/`) on macOS/Linux
3. `%APPDATA%\kroger-mcp\` on Windows

They are never written to the current working directory, which may be read-only or change between sessions under MCP hosts like Claude Desktop. Files from older versions that live in the working directory are migrated automatically on first use.

### 🚧 Kroger Public API Limitations
- **Add-only**: The public Cart API is a single endpoint, `PUT /v1/cart/add`. There is no read, no quantity update, and no delete.
- **No remove/update tools**: This fork removes upstream's `remove_from_cart` and `clear_current_cart`. They only ever edited a local JSON file while leaving the real cart untouched, which reads as a working removal when it isn't. Remove items in the Kroger app instead.
- **Local log drifts**: `view_current_cart` shows what *this server* added. It cannot see anything you add or remove elsewhere. Reset it with `mark_order_placed`.
- **Quantity**: Adding the same UPC again increases quantity. Lowering it requires the Kroger app.
- **Partner API**: Kroger's partner tier does offer full cart CRUD (`/v1/carts/...`), but access requires an agreement negotiated with Kroger Digital and is not available through self-serve app registration.

| API | Version | Rate Limit | Notes |
|-----|---------|------------|-------|
| **Authorization** | 1.0.13 | No specific limit | Token management |
| **Products** | 1.2.4 | 10,000 calls/day | Search and product details |
| **Locations** | 1.2.2 | 1,600 calls/day per endpoint | Store locations and details |
| **Cart** | 1.2.3 | 5,000 calls/day | Add/manage cart items |
| **Identity** | 1.2.3 | 5,000 calls/day | User profile information |

**Note:** Rate limits are enforced per endpoint, not per operation. You can distribute calls across operations using the same endpoint as needed.

## 🏫 Basic Workflow

1. **Set up a preferred location**:
   ```
   User: "Find Kroger stores near 90274"
   Assistant: [Uses search_locations tool]
   User: "Set the first one as my preferred location"
   Assistant: [Uses set_preferred_location tool]
   ```

2. **Search and add products**:
   ```
   User: "Add milk to my cart"
   Assistant: [Uses search_products, then add_items_to_cart]
   
   User: "Add bread, eggs, and cheese to my cart"
   Assistant: [Uses search_products for each, then bulk_add_to_cart]
   ```

3. **Manage cart and orders**:
   ```
   User: "What's in my cart?"
   Assistant: [Uses view_current_cart tool to see local memory]
   
   User: "I placed the order on the Kroger website"
   Assistant: [Uses mark_order_placed tool, moving current cart to the order history]
   ```

## 🍪 OAuth2 Authentication

When Claude attempts to modify your Kroger account, you will be asked to insert a link into your browser that will handle authentication and allow Claude to add/remove items from your cart. Ensure that you have already made a Kroger account (this is different than your Kroger development account) before attempting to paste this link into your browser to initiate authentication.
